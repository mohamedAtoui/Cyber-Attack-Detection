# Traffic Category Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing network traffic data to categorize different types of network activities. Using a dataset from the HIKARI2021 study, we perform various data processing steps and apply machine learning techniques to classify traffic into benign, probing, or other types of activities.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project, `ALLFLOWMETER_HIKARI2021.csv`, contains detailed network flow metrics collected for traffic analysis. Note: Please ensure you have the rights to access and use this data for analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip: (pip install numpy)

## Usage
To analyze the traffic data, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the data file `ALLFLOWMETER_HIKARI2021.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `traffic_analysis.ipynb`:
   - This notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning classification.
3. The notebook will output the results, including the classification accuracy and other metrics.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md` - This README file.
- `traffic_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and machine learning code.
- `data/` - Directory containing the dataset file. (Ensure you add this directory if you are using local data files)

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your enhancements.



## Acknowledgments
- HIKARI2021 dataset is in the repository.
